    "*Our group has accomplished finding multiple datasets that include helpful attributes in determining whether or not a kickstarter was successful. We have described each of the datasets and how we can combine them. We have begun the cleaning process for the data, searching for null values and deciding what we are going to do with them. We have cleaned certain columns that are categorical to be numerical in order to perform an analysis with these columns. We have also begun univate analysis of each column and visualizations (histograms), as well as bivariate analysis of multiple columns to visually see if there looks like there could be a correlation.*"
